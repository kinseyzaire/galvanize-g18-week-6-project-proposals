# QUILTTT

### description
QUILTTT lets users drag and drop quilt pattern pieces into original quilt designs

### technologies
1. CSS - work with CSS shapes masking to change the shape on the fly with a button and allow any image to be used as pattern pieces
2. jQuery - draggable()
3. APIs - screen grab API to let users save their creations; flickr API to allow users to pull in images for the quilt??

### planned stages
1. Page loads with enough quilt pieces to make a new design
2. Connect a screen grab API to allow users to save their creations locally
3. Options to add more piece sets based on shape and color (I figure color will be part of a set naming convention/directory structure that I will be able to change with radio buttons and JS)
4. Create keybinding on .piece:selected to allow users to (r)rotate, (d)delete, or (c)copy pieces when selected
5. Multiple quilt piece shape sets to allow for different quilt patterns
6. Fancy QUILTTT logo-based animation to play as page loads or as new quilt pieces are being added
7. Users can select the color of a solid quilt piece from a set palette or maybe a color-picker API
8. Users can upload their own images to be the "fabric" for the quilt pieces
9. WAY WAY STRETCH track each quilt piece used and calculate yardage for each fabric for quilters who want to design something and then actually sew it IRL

### where things are now
I've included the start of QUILTTT so you can get a general idea of where things are starting. It is a very very baseline version of what I hope it will be.
